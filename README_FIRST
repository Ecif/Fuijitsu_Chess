Fuijitsu_Chess
==============

Have to find chess piece's path to destination point on board.
I've included input and output file samples within Fuijitsu_Chess/SourceFiles/ folder.

Here's what sample input file(input.txt) contains:
Maximum board size: 8x8
Chess pieces: Knight(default), King, Queen, Rook, Bishop
----(input.txt)-----
8           [ First row is for board X-axis length. ]
8           [ Second row is for board Y-axis length. ]
A1          [ REQUIRED. Starting point coordinates. ]
H8          [ REQUIRED. Destionation point coordinates. ]
B2, D7, G6  [ Blocked positions on chess board. ]
Queen       [ Chess piece type ]
---(input.txt end)--

Do NOT skip ANY rows. If you do not wish to enter any data, use "-" instead. For Example:
----(input.txt)-----
-   [ NOT required, using "-" instead ]
-   [ NOT required, using "-" instead ]
A1  [ Always REQUIRED ]
H8  [ Always REQUIRED ]
B2  [ NOT required ]
-   [ NOT required(default is "Knight"), using "-" instead ]
---(input.txt end)--
